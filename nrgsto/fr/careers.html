			<h4 class="job__header">Position Summary</h4>
		  	<div class="job__text">As a Customer Operations Specialist, you will represent our clients in the renewable energy space by responding to the needs of their commercial &amp; industrial customers, and by owning requests &amp; issues as they come in, until they are resolved. You should expect most of the work to relate to battery storage in particular, so it will be difficult to succeed without prior renewables experience or a mind for technical learning.</div>
			<div class="job__text">From case to case, you may face tasks such as understanding battery behavior by looking at data, explaining battery performance to B2B contacts, demonstrating a software dashboard, investigating billing or contractual issues, or soliciting clients for required authorizations. In support of these functions, you will receive industry training from Custard veterans, and familiarize yourself with the commercial applications of battery storage technology and the North American landscape of the industry in general.</div>
			<div class="job__text">This position reports directly to senior decision-makers so there is ample opportunity to provide feedback, make process recommendation, demonstrate initiative with creative analysis or project management, and influence the growth of the role. Successful candidates with a track record of customer satisfaction will eventually earn the opportunity to expand the scope of their assignment with Custard’s clients and take on leadership responsibilities within our customer care team.</div>
