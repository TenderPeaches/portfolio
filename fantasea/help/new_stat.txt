Categories include but are not limited to stats; They also include data like the player's unique ID, his name, age, team, etc.

Not all categories are in use at any given time and so there are two sets of categories:
  1) tableMgr.categories, the set of categories displayed on the players' table
  2) player.categories, the set of properties of the Player object loaded in from the JSON at the beginning of the session; this set of categories is more inflexible and can only be durably modified in the exportDB.js subroutines; Methods must ensure that whenever a Player object's properties are being looped on, they keep the categories synced with tableMgr.categories
