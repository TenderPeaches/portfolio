	        		<div id="skye_testimonial" class="testimonial">
	        			<p>"Pattitude has been a lifesaver to me. Ysaac is trustworthy, responsible, professional, kind and always available when I need someone to walk Skye.... even last minute! Skye loves their walks together.  I know she has been really well taken care of because Ysaac sends me pictures of her dog park adventures. She is also always very tired :)  I recommend Pattitude to everyone now!  Thank you Ysaac, keep up the great work!" -Leah </p>

	        			<p>"I trust Ysaac 100%, he is always available and takes great care of my two dogs. He is professional and it takes someone who is patient and calm with a dog like Thor, who is not always easy to walk and can be reactive toward other dogs. Thankfully, Ysaac knows how to handle him during these tricky situations. I have nothing but good words for Ysaac and strongly recommend him to anyone looking for a professional dog walker." -Celica (<a href="../index.html#lokithor_testiomnial">Original Quote</a>)</p>

	        			<p>"Pattitude is all that one could wish for in a pet-sitting/walking service, and then some! Ysaac is pleasant, professional, reliable and fair-minded, but most of all Sailor and Olive adore him. He has worked wonders with my precious duo. As they say, the proof is in the pudding! Since he has been walking them, I’ve noticed that they are less reactive to such random distractions as other dogs and squirrels, and Sailor especially has slimmed down. Ysaac has a caring way with dogs, and I have peace of mind when they’re out with him." -Claudia</p>

            			<p>"I have 3 large dogs and they are in love with Ysaac. He is very attentive to their needs and he understands their individual personalities very well. He is very responsible and I wouldn’t entrust my dogs to anyone else. He is very good with my cat as well and she is just nasty!!!!" -Douglas</p>
