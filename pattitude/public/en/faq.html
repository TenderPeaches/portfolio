        	<h3>How does Pattitude operate?</h3>
        	<p>A preliminary meet-and-greet with a member of our staff is first scheduled at your convenience. This meeting aims to establish a first contact with your dog(s) in a familiar environment. We also use this opportunity to ask you a series of questions intended to pinpoint your dog's needs and personality. Finally, should everything be to your liking, you may end the interview by signing the contract agreement and providing us a spare key to the premises, if necessary. This meeting generally lasts between 15 and 30 minutes.</p>
        	<p>Once the meeting is over, you are now free to order our services by phone, text message, <a href="mailto:info@pattitude.ca">e-mail</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pattitudemtl">Facebook</a> or our <a href="order.html">website</a>. We will confirm the booking and send you an estimate through through the same means.</p>
        	<p>We strongly encourage you to forward us any questions, updates, comments, complaints or other information you may deem relevant. In return, we commit ourselves to send you an electronic follow-up after each of our services, detailing how everything went.</p>
        	<h3>How are the services billed?</h3>
            <p>The bills are issued on the first day of the month and include all the services performed during the previous month. Once the bill is issued, you have a 14-day period during which you can send us the payment without additional charges.</p>
			<p>We accept payment through the following methods:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Credit card (through the <a href="https://squareup.com/help/ca/en/">Square</a> application)</li>
				<li>Online interac transfer</li>
				<li>Cash</li>
				<li>Check</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Should you desire to pay cash or by check but are unable to deliver us the money directly, you may leave it in your home so that one of our employees can pick it up during the next visit. In any case, you will be sent an electronic receipt by e-mail as soon as possible.</p>
			<h3>Do you accept all dogs?</h3>
			<p>We accept dogs of any breed, size and age. Should your dog exhibit behavioral issues, we will gladly help you work through them. We only reject dogs if they pose a danger to themselves or to our personnel.</p>
			<h3>What is convered by the insurance and liability policy?</h3>
			<p>In case of complications, we are covered by <a href="http://www.binks.ca/programs/pet-sitters/">Binks' insurance and bonding policy</a>. Of course, we shall expend every effort to not require it but, should an unexpected issue arise, the policy covers the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Replacement of the keys and locks in case of lost key.</li>
				<li>Theft.</li>
				<li>Damage to your property.</li>
				<li>Damage caused by your dog to other animals, people or property.</li>
				<li>Injury sustained by your animal(s).</li>
				<li>Dishonest acts from our employees.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can provide an insurance certificate on demand, should you request more information.</p>
