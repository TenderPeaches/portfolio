            <p id="title">About Pattitude</p>

            <p>Pattitude provides flexible, efficient and responsible service to meet the needs of dog and pet owners in the Montreal area. Whether for a single walk or a longer stay, in the snow or during your summer vacation, we will gladly take care of your pets when you are unable to do so yourself – or just need a break. Each interaction is supported with professional training expertise, and we provide live updates and after-the-fact recaps to ensure your total peace of mind.</p>
            <p>Positive reinforcement training is the new standard and we strictly avoid any aversive methods. Beyond ethical considerations, punishment is simply an ineffective learning strategy that does not help the dog understand its expected behavior, often leading to a variety of undesirable and unpredictable negative side effects. Instead, systematically identifying and rewarding desired behavior creates clarity and fosters a healthy relationship between you and your pet.</p>
            <p>You may have heard of Montreal's new <a href="http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/sel/sypre-consultation/afficherpdf?idDoc=27628&typeDoc=1">16-060 regulation</a>, implemented by former mayor Denis Coderre's team. Part of a wider legislative trend to target allegedly dangerous dog breeds, its main effect is lowering the quality of life of countless loving dogs and responsible pet owners (although the breed-specific features of the legislation have been repealed by mayor Valérie Plante's administration). Its introduction has sparked spirited discussion within our community and we seek to contribute to that dialogue by using modern education to eliminate the harmful myths that motivate such unconstructive and inadmissible laws.</p>
          	<p>Please note that Pattitude’s transportation and administrative policies are both designed with the reduction of our carbon footprint in mind at all times.</p>

            <h3>Ysaac</h3>

            <img id="image_1" src="../img/ysaac4.jpg"/>
            <p>Since his earliest days, Ysaac always took care of his relatives’ animals when they were away. After pursuing higher education in computer science, he returned to his lifelong passion by attending the excellent <a href="http://www.coeurcanin.com/">CoeurCanin</a> training program and finding employment in the Montreal pet boarding and daycare industry. Pattitude is the brainchild of both of those fields, delivering a lifelong commitment to pet care, advanced training experience and the cutting-edge platform needed to meet our client’s highly personal needs.</p>
